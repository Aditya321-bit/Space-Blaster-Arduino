# Space Blaster – Arduino Game

Space Blaster is a mini arcade-style **space shooter game** developed using **Arduino** and an **OLED display**.  
The project demonstrates how core programming concepts and embedded systems libraries can be combined to build a real-time interactive game on limited hardware.
---
## Project Overview
The game runs on an Arduino board and displays graphics on an OLED screen using the **U8g2 graphics library**.  
Player input is taken through push buttons to control a spaceship, fire bullets, and destroy incoming asteroids.

---
## Gameplay
- Player controls a spaceship using buttons  
- Bullets are fired to destroy asteroids  
- Asteroids spawn randomly on the screen  
- Score increases on successful hits  
- Game logic runs in a continuous loop  

---
## Programming Concepts Used
- Functions for  game logic  
- Arrays to manage bullets and asteroid positions  
- Loops for the main game cycle  
- Conditional statements for collision detection  
- Use of multiple libraries for display and hardware control  

---

## Libraries Used
- **U8g2** – OLED graphics rendering 
--
## Hardware Components
- Arduino UNO / Nano  
- OLED Display (SSD1306)  
- Push Buttons  
- Buzzer
